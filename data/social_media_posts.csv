Duterte is loved by many filipinos and the actions taken by the ICC were a political motive. I hope the ICC will investigate truly and not misinform by politicians. if you want to know the truth ask citizens of the philippines if duterte really a villain or a hero.

Elise Stefanik,
Death, destruction, starvation in the holy lands, yuck. Anyways back to taxes, what’s your opinion on timber prices this quarter, year? Surely you know since the family business is plywood. How’s it possible for you to start at 2018 net worth at $282,007, but now be at $2 million? Mommy and Daddy bought you a DC mansion for $1.3 million, but who owns it? Hubby Matt is a congressional staffer for Rep Kevin Yoder but also works in marketing in the gun industry? Trump is giving you ambassador of the UN to be on the world stage? But what happens if the USA pulls the UN funding, what will you do, ie do you have a Plan B? Anyways all this weapons trading is shady. Now we got Mahmoud, expectant father, in prison in Louisiana, kinda a mess. Anyways for tax purposes sure would love advice on timber pricing, maybe your fam should buy a farm to feed timber to your business

Hunger is horrific in Gaza this month. Its victims suffer from the sadism of the occupier and the indifference of the shepherds who profit from their suffering. Hunger is most painful when it is punitive, aimless, and meaningless. The gap between the leaders' slogans and the reality of the suffering is like the distance between heaven and earth. Don't stop talking about Gaza. Share

There was no terrorism in Pakistan during Imran Khan's government. Whenever Nawaz, Shehbaz Sharif, Maryam Nawaz, Asif Zardari, Bilawal Zardari and their servants, military generals are together, then why does terrorism increase in Pakistan? To divert people's attention from their false and corrupt government and to wage war on others in exchange for dollars. The tea is that Pakistan will be torn apart. Everyone understands this now.

Our state has to address the genuine issues of the locals of not only Baluchistan but every single province in minority. These people are only angry on the state because no one is there to hear them. Karachi is also struggling with basic human rights issues but for us, our homeland is always the first priority, we never took any bold step against the state nor we will ever go against our country. But this is the prime time to address the genuine issues of the people across the country. We can't beat these kind of incidents. Our enemies are always eyeing on us to wipe us out.

The major colonisers of the earth have predominantly been White Western powers, spreading from Europe to seize control of the Americas, Australia, Asia, and Africa. They came with promises of progress and civilisation, offering new systems and structures under the guise of advancement. At first, it seemed as though they sought only to explore and connect distant lands.

But this facade soon gave way to a far grimmer truth. These powers plundered the world's wealth, enslaved entire populations, and tore apart the very fabric of indigenous societies. They claimed lands that were not theirs, silencing centuries of culture and wisdom. Families were broken, communities destroyed, and countless lives reduced to mere tools for profit.

The scale of their violence grew with each passing decade. Genocide, forced labour, and engineered famines became tools of control, leaving scars that bled into the hearts of nations. Resources were stripped bare, lands were ravaged, and rivers ran red with the cost of their greed.

By the end, these empires stood triumphant, their cities adorned with the stolen wealth of others. Yet their triumph was built on mountains of suffering—a legacy not of progress, but of cruelty, exploitation, and death. The world they reshaped still trembles under the weight of their deeds, their evil carved into history as a haunting reminder of what ambition without humanity can unleash.

Conducting negotiations between two countries at war on an official level means at least three days long ceasefire. But not 30 days, that's an absurd demand unless the war is guaranteed to end by then....... Actually don't need a ceasefire to negotiate, only need a ceasefire to show good faith or to rearm

I wish there wa a bit more context about this. Volcan Fuego erupts all the time. This is why many visitors do a hike to be able to see the phenomenon every 20-30 mins approx. However, the news this week (Tuesday, March 11) is that the eruption was much stronger and called a “massive eruption”, which is reason for 300K people to evacuate. I hope everyone is ok and stays safe!

Friday, 19th July 2024 | World Court Finds Israel Responsible for Apartheid
𓂆
The World Court has rejected all Israeli, US & western objections, ruled that the Israeli occupation of Gaza & the West Bank, including East Jerusalem (and all settlements), is entirely unlawful & declares Israel is committing racial segregation/ apartheid in the OPT.
𓂆
And it rules that Israel must evacuate all settlers, dismantle settlements and the wall, provide full reparations to Palestinian victims, and allow all Palestinians who were forced out to return.
𓂆
All states and international organizations must end any aid or assistance to the occupation and must take action to ensure that Israel complies and ends the occupation.

Artinya:
""Dan orang-orang kafir dihalau ke neraka Jahanam berkelompok-kelompok. Sehingga apabila mereka sampai ke neraka itu, pintu-pintunya dibukakan dan para penjaganya berkata kepada mereka: 'Apakah belum datang kepada kalian rasul-rasul dari kalangan kalian sendiri yang membacakan kepada kalian ayat-ayat Tuhan kalian dan memperingatkan kalian akan pertemuan dengan hari ini?' Mereka menjawab: 'Benar, tetapi ketetapan azab telah berlaku terhadap orang-orang kafir.'""

Muslim Ban Trump who has endorsed a plan to forcibly remove Palestinians from Gaza and the West Bank?

He wants to do a mutually beneficial deal with Iranians after scrapping the deal we had before in his first term?

What the hell are you smoking??

To those suddenly speaking up about Syria—where was your outrage when Assad, his militants, and their backers from Iran, Russia, and Hezbollah massacred millions of Syrians? You were silent then, but now you focus on selective narratives.
Many of the videos being circulated are actually old footage from Assad’s past massacres, being reused as if they are happening now. Some even include misidentified victims, like people who are still alive or unrelated images from other countries.
If you now question media bias on Syria, why do you still trust these same sources when it comes to Palestine? The sudden wave of Assadist propaganda and misinformation is not random—it is being pushed to keep Syrians distracted from Palestine and the ongoing occupation of Syrian and Lebanese lands.
For 14 years, Assad’s regime has been killing Syrians, yet only now do some people ‘wake up’? The same disinformation tactics used to dehumanize Palestinians—spreading fabricated stories to manipulate public perception—are now being used in Syria. Assadists are employing the same strategies.
To be clear, civilian casualties have occurred, and the temporary Syrian government is already arresting and prosecuting those responsible. The difference is accountability—something Assad’s regime never had

To those suddenly speaking up about Syria—where was your outrage when Assad, his militants, and their backers from Iran, Russia, and Hezbollah massacred millions of Syrians? You were silent then, but now you focus on selective narratives.
Many of the videos being circulated are actually old footage from Assad’s past massacres, being reused as if they are happening now. Some even include misidentified victims, like people who are still alive or unrelated images from other countries.
If you now question media bias on Syria, why do you still trust these same sources when it comes to Palestine? The sudden wave of Assadist propaganda and misinformation is not random—it is being pushed to keep Syrians distracted from Palestine and the ongoing occupation of Syrian and Lebanese lands.
For 14 years, Assad’s regime has been killing Syrians, yet only now do some people ‘wake up’? The same disinformation tactics used to dehumanize Palestinians—spreading fabricated stories to manipulate public perception—are now being used in Syria. Assadists are employing the same strategies.
To be clear, civilian casualties have occurred, and the temporary Syrian government is already arresting and prosecuting those responsible. The difference is accountability—something Assad’s regime never had

At God’s Will Dog Shelter, every meal is a struggle. Stray dogs arrive starving, broken, and desperate for kindness, but food is scarce, and donations are rare. Some days, we don’t know how we’ll keep going—but we can’t turn them away. They have no one else. Every bit of support means the difference between hunger and hope, suffering and survival.

So from Kpk to Punjab to Sindh to Balochistan. Total 4 provinces. & my question is what was police & army doing at check posts??? In just a city there are many check posts of army & they passed whole big province of Pakistan(Punjab) & Army was sleeping....Role of army in a country is to safe people & defence but unfortunately our country is run by amry & thus it has all it's interest in inside, if they really mind their own business then why do such incidents happens daily , why smuggling happens through borders, what is army doing at borders??? And then they say Balochistan is a part of Pakistan??!!! Everyday something horrible is happening in Balochistan.

Mahmoud Khalil isn’t an illegal alien. He isn’t a terrorist. He’s a Columbia graduate student and a legal U.S. resident. He's a husband. And his wife, a US Citizen—8 months pregnant—has no idea where he is.

The Department of Homeland Security snatched him off campus, disappeared him without a trace. No charges. No trial. Just gone. This is how authoritarian regimes operate.
It's what happens when the First Amendment only applies to the “right” kind of people—it's only a trial balloon for a broader crackdown on speech.

If they can do it to Khalil, they can do it to you.

First, they come for the speech of legal immigrants.

If we don't speak up, do you know what comes next?

The outcome that we saw on TV (or in our case, Youtube) was just proof that Trump isn't on the side of Ukraine, but on the side of Russia actually. The whole rundown on Ukraine's president by Trump, telling in face-to-face that he's losing soldiers and adding a lot to the burden he's already handling, is just evidence that there's no path towards a TRUE peace talk. Trump sides with Putin. That's the truth.

Hey @aljazeeraenglish how about you report the facts and don't present this as some kind of hit to democracy. Like how he loves doing N@zi salutes, how he has broken electoral laws,how he's under investigation for many types of fraud, how his backed by the most extreme hate groups in our country, how his chief of security is an actual mercenary with close ties to Chechnya's Khadyrov, Russia's Wagner group and other paramilitary organizations? That his associates were recently raided and found to have large stashes of illegal weapons,including Semtex and grenade launchers? How there are hours upon hours of phone recordings between his team and the Russian consulate in coordinating election fraud? L take on presenting him as some kind of people's hero. He idolizes the country's WW2 fascists regime for crying out loud.

@aljazeeraenglish what is this???? this is not how presedential election goes in Romania, top 2 who get most votes go into the final phase of the presedential elections. we vote in 2 rounds, and the fact that he got many votes in the first round DOES NOT MEAN he was the president of our country.

The reason this is such a big deal is bc Israel does not allow Palestinians to build their own infrastructure. They can not create their own power grid, water pipelines, or anything else to run from a different source of energy. It's made to look like Israel is being benevolent with the energy they're ""providing.""

Except that the feeling is not mutual given that the US wants regime change in Ukraine and does not really want to talk to him. Good luck with all the painful concessions he will be forced into!

Since the beginning of time, war has plagued humanity. We can’t even live in peace among our own but we keep talking about aliens. What do you think would happen with them if they actually revealed themselves to communicate?👽💥💥💥

Zelensky is doomed because Zelensky has been deceived by his Western Allies.

The fire didn't 'broke out' but was set alight deliberately!

Oh please, the same day Israel turns off electricity to Gaza, a fire magically sparks up and destroys a huge supply of food in the middle of a genocide, and we are supposed to believe people don't know who did it? Israel has bombed Gazan's food supplies multiple times, and recently advocated to do it again, there is no way in hell this wasn't Israel setting this blaze.
